    "image classification CNNs focus on recognizing the entire image as a single object, outputting one label (e.g., \"dog\"). They use simpler architectures that extract high-level features and reduce the image to a single class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object detection CNNs, on the other hand, must both recognize and locate multiple objects within an image. They include extra components like region proposals and bounding boxes, making them more complex. The model predicts both the class of each object and its location (bounding box).\n"

    "R-CNN, and how does it help in identifying objects in an image?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Region Proposal Network (RPN) in Faster R-CNN helps identify potential regions in an image that might contain objects. It works by generating anchor boxes (predefined bounding boxes) across the image and predicting whether each box likely contains an object (objectness score). The RPN also refines these boxes to better fit the objects and filters out redundant or irrelevant regions using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). By proposing relevant regions, the RPN speeds up the object detection process and improves accuracy by focusing only on likely areas for further analysis."

This deep stacking allows the network to capture increasingly complex features at different levels. Its simplicity—just convolutional layers followed by pooling and fully connected layers—improves image classification by progressively refining the learned features, making it highly effective for tasks like object recognition, while keeping the architecture straightforward."
